			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Grand Theft Auto 

Video games are becoming more and more popular every year. With advancements in technology every day, the virtual world is becoming a lot like the real world we live in today. Children all the way up to adults play video games, sometimes hours on end. So with this form of entertainment being so prevalent in our lives today, where do we cross the line when it comes to violence and bad behavior being portrayed in the games such as Grand Theft Auto. Video games now can be played by anyone who can move, you don’t need a controller anymore. The technology behind these games like the Wii and Kinect are incredible. These games allow you to stand in a room and control the game by your movements. Ten years ago that idea sounded surreal but is now a reality. So with the video games becoming so real and graphic how do we allow children to play violent games such as Grand theft Auto? The release of the new Grand Theft Auto V had record breaking sales across the world. People are lining up out the doors to purchase the game. This may sound absurd but today the game has become so life-like you can do whatever you want in it and the consumers get a “rush” as if we were the ones in the video game committing the crimes.
