			<p>The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) is the official rating system that is labeled on the video games. The ratings they give, from least strict to most strict, are Early Childhood, Everyone, Everyone 10+, Teen, Mature and Adults Only. I am alright with this scale and am glad there are these ratings on the games. I am also alright with the harsh sanctions that come along with incomplete content disclosure that range from up to one million dollar fines to total product recall. My proposition to reduce the number of children and young consumers from acquiring the game is to incorporate harsh fines or punishments to legal guardians allowing the person, not meeting the required rating requirement, to play the video game. From personal testimony I find that too many parents are ignorant to what their children are exposed to. If parents are concerned about fines or some sort of punishment by law, they will take harder looks into what their children are being exposed to, in turn, reducing the desensitizing exposure to content to mature for them. By limiting the individuals that play the game that don’t meet the rating systems standards, I feel will reduce aggression levels in teens and people across the world. It goes back to the fact that with repeated and constant exposure to violent and vulgar content will desensitize the consumer to this behavior which could be dangerous to themselves, or like in the incident listed earlier, it can be harmful to innocent others. I would do everything in my power if I were the parents of Zachary Burgess to look closer to the effects of video games on people, especially young, volatile, dramatic teens who could see this behavior as alright.
That is why I feel we should create new punishments for the underage use of violent and vulgar video games. Should we wait for the next violent incident to occur to look further into the link between violent video games and violent behavior? Let’s remind ourselves that I am not talking about something were forced to do; this is a form of entertainment that millions of people of all ages play. Am I the only one completely disturbed with the number one video game being Grand Theft Auto V? Have we let our morals go so low that it’s now fun to sit in front of a television and play as a virtual human being that goes around killing random people in any way they feel like? We need to stop turning our heads the other way to this electronic form of entertainment. The world is moving at a very fast pace now, we cannot sit back and wait for things to happen and react after. This issue of video games being linked to crime in real life is not a new headline.
