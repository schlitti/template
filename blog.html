					<li>The purpose of this video was to talk about the obvious seperation of gays and non-gays and how once you're honest with yourself it gets alot better</li>
					<li>I feel the video is reaching out (which it has with almost 200,000 views) to others who are in the same predicament that he was or of similar nature.</li>
					<li>The structure of the video was given in third person in a narative, oral structure. He used accounts in his life and spoke them in a story like way</li>
					<li>It shows a better format for how to write this paper, some of my paragraphs were not narative but now I understand the correct format.</li>
