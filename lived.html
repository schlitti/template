Lived Experiences Project 
	
	The career path that interests me the most is that of one in marketing and/or advertising. Many experiences in my life and other influences have brought me towards this. I do question what I want sometimes but these experiences remind me how that through hard work mixed with my creativity I can become successful at it. The creativity aspect of the career is probably what attracts me the most. Work can be done to just get it done and move on. To me the room to leave my own touch on my work provides my work to become something great, marketing and advertising opens room for me to do what I want to do with it. 
	I can remember when I first was gifted the computer art design program for my birthday. My relatives knew I was into art and design so they bought me the program so I could mess around with it. I loved trying new things on it and acquired decent skills with it. The program I believe is called “Coolpix” and is step up from the typical “paint” program that comes along with Microsoft Software.
 I continued to keep up with my interest in art throughout school, but acquired an interest in business when I joined the DECA business club. DECA is competitive club that builds young business experience by holding prestigious conferences and putting the students in real life situations that they try to solve using what they know and are scored compared to the other 14,000 students. There is something like 30 different competitive topics and I chose marketing and advertising. I worked with a partner and passed the district and state competition. We were top of all the lists for best presentation of the few kids who made it on to nationals.
 After our last competition we were walking out and saw our judge smoking outside and she called us over and acknowledged how great we did with the artistic selling points that we presented. No other groups thought of what we did and she was wowed by our presentation. I did the layout as well as all of the examples for the ads. We were timed and didn’t have much at all so we drew many examples of ads we would post at certain areas. I will never forget that because then and there I knew I could take my passion, interest and skills and turn it into money. We went on to nationals and I saw that other students were just as ambitious as I was to win. Along with that they were also just as skillful as I was with preparing advertisements. We didn’t end up winning but I evaluated how far I went with DECA and was very pleased with myself. That was one of the bigger moments in my life as a student as well as probably the most real-life situations I’ve faced to this date.
 	My skills with understanding marketing and how people react to different things have all increased significantly because now I know I can do something great with my passion. I do wish I could acquire an internship trying out my skills somehow because at the moment it’s just little drawings here and there. I do really hope this class can teach me a few things with online design and maybe more. I am required to take a WRA 100 level class and was very pleased when I got into this one because of the online design aspect.  
	Another huge moment that moved me and inspired me to follow this career path was when I first saw the show MAD MEN. This show to me is written amazingly. It may not be a true story but it took a guy with a hard past and turned him into the brilliant advertising giant known as Don Draper. I was fascinated at this because this was time I actually was able to see how advertising firms were ran daily, losing and gaining clients, ideas being chosen and thrown away for all sorts of companies. I loved every second of it watching Don build his company using the skills that I can see myself having or learning. His creativity shocked all of his clients and that’s what I would like to do with my work. I saw so many examples of advertisements from the early 50’s and 60’s, and am amazed how creative the firms were, my favorite being the Volkswagen beetle ads that were created by the Berbachs in the 60’s. I learned many things from the fictional character Don Draper on how to always write down your good ideas you have during the day so that you will not forget them later. I gave it a try and it actually works well in all aspects of your daily life. 
	Growing up my very close cousin that is only a year younger than me was awesome we would spend afternoon after afternoon drawing and using the online programs we got to design cars, people, landscapes and more. We loved to be more creative than each other which taught me how to be competitive in an artistic sense that could become very useful in the workplace. Our moms (my mom and my aunt) encouraged us to work together on certain things which we could add our own touches to. We ended up liking a lot of things that we did together which taught me that I will have my own ideas to use but others inputs are just as useful sometimes. All of these instances have showed me things that interest me and lead me down the path I am currently pursuing. 
	Social media, one of the world’s greatest inventions of the last ten years has opened all kinds of room for advertising and marketing advancements. Facebook, for example, held its head high for how clean and uncluttered their home page was for so long. As we all know now the website is littered with annoying advertisements and soon to have pop-ups. Twitter too, is one of the easiest apps to use now has “promoted ads” which show up in your news feed and looks like any other tweet. Social media has changed the advertising game forever. Unfortunately the boom of social media has already taken place and the generation above me has reaped its benefits. One of my favorite new apps is Vine, Vine allows six seconds of video that people can make very funny, but now companies are paying the users with a lot of followers to promote their product through the videos. I am very excited to see what kind of platform of technology will be invented next that will be open to advertising.
	No one knows what is going to happen to them in the future, but I know if I work at something hard enough I will accomplish my goal. I plan to work hard and become a part of one of the best advertising firms in the country. I am very excited for the path ahead of me and cannot wait to see what happens. But all of these pieces of technology as well as life experiences have led me to this point in my life and I have no regrets.
