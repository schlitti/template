			<p>With the game taking off like it did, and understanding its content could you see how perhaps we, the consumers, are becoming desensitized to violence and vulgar content? An article written in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Volume 42, issue 4 looks into the effects of chronic violent video game exposure. The article points out, “most people naturally have aversive reactions to the sight of blood and gore.” And that some people are used to it because their job or duty is related to it. They are able to desensitize to the exposure, by adapting to ignore irrelevant behavior and focus on relevant information while exposed to sensitive material. So what happens when hundreds of millions of copies of gory, violent games are distributed across the world to all ages, where violent behavior is the “relevant information”, in turn desensitizing these people to the vulgarity? Personally I see that allowing people to become comfortable with these actions. Not only are we allowed to acquire such media, we are encouraged to purchase it through advertising mediums everywhere. Teenagers and children, some of the most influential minds, are getting these forms of entertainment and exposing themselves to this type of violence allowing them to feel that this behavior is normal amongst society. Do you think that all teenagers can understand the fine line of what’s right and wrong when they’re playing violent video games day after day? Researchers today are finding that people who play violent video games cannot help the increase in aggression they receive. Dr. Mario Vance, a psychological researcher at Rapture Institute for head-line inspired science, did a study that lasted seven years on a thousand volunteers that are prevalent in the gaming community. He monitored the anger levels of the volunteers and his research showed an increase in overall aggressiveness. My own testimony to the subject would agree with his findings. I find myself getting very aggravated when things don’t go how I want them to go within the game. I think many people would agree that when they play any video game they get frustrated when they lose.
September 23rd at roughly 2:30 a.m. Baton Rouge Police Department was called to the Tigerland area in Baton Rouge, LA in response to a stolen vehicle and erratic driver. Apparently Zachary Burgess, a freshman Auburn lacrosse player, had seen a vehicle unattended and took the opportunity to steal the car with a woman inside. He held the lady against her will and decided to ram the 9 other vehicles around the area. While he was being questioned he stated that he “wanted to see what it was really like to play the video game Grand Theft Auto.” This could just be a bad, drunken decision by a twenty year old student. But to me this goes beyond the normal crime spree. He was influenced by a form of entertainment to go commit crimes. Apparently the players of the game feel some sort of rush that they play, and crave this rush. This rush allowed the FIFTH version of the game to become a record selling game! Zachary was influenced to the point where he accepted the consequences, which he was charged with theft of a motor vehicle, nine accounts of hit and run and simple kidnapping as well as a nice eighty thousand dollar bond.
As a consumer and owner of many violent video games, which I find entertaining, I feel there needs to be stricter laws and enforcement of who can acquire certain games.
